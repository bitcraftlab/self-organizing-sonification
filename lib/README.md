## About

Central location for the libraries used by all sketches in this repo. 

* `libraries/p5.js` ... currently using p5.js v0.5.3 with minor improvements  
* `index.html` ... using the same index.html for every p5i.js sketch  

## Adding new sketches

* copy the `index.html` to the sketch directory
* symlink the `libraries` folder
* add your custom `sketch.js`
