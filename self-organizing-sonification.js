 *  In the Self-Organizing Sonification workshop we will learn how to use self-organization *
 *  to visualize + sonify data. We will learn how to create our own bottom up sonifications *
 *  from scratch and make them run inside the browser.                                      *
 *                                                                                          *
 *  As part of the course we will get to know various computational systems that result in  *
 *  self-organization - such as chemical particle simulations and self organizing maps -    *
 *  and we will learn how to implement them using javascript and p5.js.                     *
 *                                                                                          *
 *  We will work both with textual data and with human motion captured and stored in the    *
 *  notorious Graffitti Markup Language (GML).                                              *
 *  We will use p5.js in the browser to dynamically process and visualize our data.         *
 *  Once we have mastered the basics of bottom-up dataviz, we will transfer the principles  *
 *  to the field of data sonification.                                                      *
 *                                                                                          *
 *  As part of the course I will provide an overview of bottom-up-dataviz methods developed *
 *  specificially for this course and my accompanying talk at the OpenFields conference.    *
 *  However the main focus is on enabling the students to develop and explore little        *
 *  computational systems of their own.                                                     *
 *                                                                                          *
 *  Basic coding skills in p5.js or Processing or Javascript are highly recommended.        *
 *                                                                                          *
